    <h1>Here we will put information about the Indian flag with the background colour orange, present in Indian flag.
    </h1>

        The national flag of India, colloquially called Tiraṅgā (the tricolour), is a horizontal rectangular tricolour
        flag, the colours being of India saffron, white and India green; with the Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke wheel, in
        navy blue at its centre.[1][2] It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly
        held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Union of India on 15 August 1947. The flag was
        subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the term "tricolour" almost always refers to
        the Indian national flag.

        While the flag agitation got its impetus from Gandhi's writings and discourses, the movement received political
        acceptance following the Nagpur incident. News reports, editorials and letters to editors published in various
        journals and newspapers of the time attest to the subsequent development of a bond between the flag and the
        nation. Soon, the concept of preserving the honour of the national flag became an integral component of the
        independence struggle. While Muslims were still wary of the Swaraj flag, it gained acceptance among Muslim
        leaders of the Congress and the Khilafat Movement as the national flag.
